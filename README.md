# Automated Billing Software

## Overview
Created by the students of CSE - C 1st year, this Python-based billing system uses pandas (2.2.3) to manage CSV files, which serves as a database. In also includes error handling for some cases where certain database files which do not exist.  This system uses a menu-driven interface, where the users can choose the options to perform different functions.  The admin and employee functions handle user authentication and authorization, ensuring only authorized users can access specific features. The code uses pandas library to manage data storage and retrieval. Split into assmodule1.py (backend) and assignment.py (CLI).  The assmodule1 module is likely a custom module that contains function for data management such as add_data, update_data, del_data, display_data, check_admin and check_employee.  Overall this code provides a basic framework for managing data and user authentication in a simple database system.Run with Python 3.13.3 and pandas.  See README to contribute.

- **Data Storage:** Uses CSV files (`database.csv`, `admin.csv`, `employee.csv`).
- **Modular Design:** Backend (`assmodule1.py`) and CLI (`assignment.py`).
